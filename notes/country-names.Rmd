- UN Stats "Standard country or area codes for statistical use," the [M49 standard](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/#geo-regions)
	- Derived from [ISO 3166](https://iso.org/obp/ui/#search); someone has put up all the countries, regions, sub regions up on [github](https://github.com/lukes/ISO-3166-Countries-with-Regional-Codes/blob/master/all/all.csv) as a csv but updated 2020
	- "Geographic regions" provide regions as well
	- Someone's made a package for this: [countrycode](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/countrycode) that is more frequently updated
- Also known as "UN Geoscheme with regional codes"
- Could also use [rworldmap](https://github.com/AndySouth/rworldmap/) package

The levels are:
- country (Afghanistan, Albania)
- region - Asia, Europe
- sub-region - Southern Asia, Northern Europe
- intermediate region - Middle Africa, South America, Caribbean

wpp data is a bit annoying because it has all of these levels combined. Perhaps we can simply match on "country"? THis uses the csv file in `raw/`.
